## Searching
Anything can be searched from the BX-Books.csv using Elasticsearch by clicking the "SEARCH" button.

## Sort 
Books with bigger "rating" or "user_rating" are higher in the search results. 

## Neural Network 
The neural network by using word embeddings (word2vec) predicts ratings of books depending on the taste of the user who uses the search engine. This makes the sorting better.

## Clustering
Use of K-means and word embeddings for book clustering (depending on their plot).
